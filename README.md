# Documentation: 

## Git:

I only use my git repo to keep track of backups and the version. I have not had to branch out or roll back my version.

## Server:

Descriptions of API calls are in the files above the function.

The server does not have global variables, when an API is called it will open the file it needs, reads and writes accordingly, then closes and saves the file.
